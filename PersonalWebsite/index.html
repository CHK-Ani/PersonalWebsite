    <u><h2 style="margin-left: 500px; text-align: center;">A Servant For Innovation</h2></u>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; max-width: 1000px;">
    Currently enrolled at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Information Systems. 
    As a CIS major, I am passionate about technology and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. 
    Concentrations include data analytics, product management, and digital innovation.
    At GSU I participate in several clubs including the Student Government Association, 
    Cybersecurity Club, Web Development Club, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Institute, and more. 
    All of these are relevant to my passions for technology and leadership, 
    which I strive to use in my current and future career endeavors.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 500px; max-width: 1000px;">
        With a strong history foundation of product strategy, data analytics, and research in my role as a technical advisor and administrator at GSU Learning Centers, along with my role as Product Manager and software development intern at GE Vernova forming a wide range of software/technical development skills but also market research and product road mapping. This stems from my independent motivation to strive to bring great leadership qualities and collaborate productively within groups. Additionally, I strive to foster communication and community, solving problems from new angles and thinking with proficiency in new data and research. This opportunity is ideal because my professional goals align with great mission and values. My technical, critical thinking, leadership, and interpersonal abilities will support and drive organizational success. I’m hoping to lead a community that drives that mission forward. And I hope to bring passion, growth, and excellence to that mission.
